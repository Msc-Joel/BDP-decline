          If you have a long line it will eventually wrap. Images will be
          automatically resized so they don't get too big. If you resize the
          window the content will stay in the center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't use br tags. Each line is a p tag, which is a paragraph. br tags
          aren't really used any more, they're an old-fashioned way to create a
          new line.

          If you want the text area to be smaller or larger, look at around line
          200 in style.css - there's a rule for .site-container which sets the
          width to 40em. You can make the number larger or smaller.

          To automatically format a document in VS Code, press Command+Shift+P,
          then type "Format Document" and hit enter. VS Code will automatically
          shift everything around and try to make it look more organized for
          you! It won't work if there are errors, though...
