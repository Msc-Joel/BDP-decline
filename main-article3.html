                <h2>A closer look at the global ivory trade</h2>
                <p> 
                    Currently going for about $3,300 per pound, the global trade in ivory is worth about USD23 billion annually, a reality made plain by the gruesome photos of butchered elephants that have become almost commonplace. <br>
                    However, a ban on ivory was imposed many years ago, instead there is a legal ivory trade taking place on the sidelines; in whale bones, lion claws, tortoise shells and other species. This trade appears to have replaced the sale of elephant tusks and rhino horns. Studies have shown that ivory trade, however legal, can influence the slaughter of protected species if demand continues to increase. In most African countries, lions are increasingly being slaughtered for their teeth and claws, likely made into jewelry and sold in Asian markets. I am on a journey to explore this legal ivory trade with a view to find out who is selling what to whom?

                    The UN international trade database is the best place to start if one wishes to establish the total value of ivory trade from 2017 to 2021. This is a period marked by high cases of poaching in Africa. The database helps to identify countries with the highest appetite for ivory and those that export the product throughout the world. <br>
UN Comtrade database for five African countries; Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania shows that ivory worth around USD600 billion was traded between 2017 and 2021. On average, the shipment weighs around three tons. The data also shows that on average, a consignment of ivory is sold at around USD15 000, according to the data, with the most expensive consignment sold at around USD23 million. Air transport has been the preferred mode of transport for the ivory products to feed demand for ivory products in East Asia and mostly in the West. <br>

The COVID-19 pandemic appears not to have dampened the spirits of exporters and importers. According to the UN international trade database, Tanzania leads in ivory trade between 2017 and 2021, attracting a sizable market share with a sale of around USD60 million in 2020 alone. Data shows that in 2021, Tanzania exports exceeded USD97 million at a time that other African countries did not export. In total, at USD300 million, Tanzania five-year ivory export trade accounts for half of Africa’s trade. Kenya's five-year export reached USD10 million in the same period.<br>

<span class="article3-h3"> US leads global importers</span> <br>
The majority of people who buy products made from ivory are from the US, a country at the forefront of banning the sale of ivory. In 2017, the US imported ivory worth around US$400 million. Among young fashionistas in the low-to-middle income bracket, ivory is seen as a way to project an image of wealth and social status. Ivory from the tortoise shell is used for making ornaments, including bracelets and eyeglass frames. With a steady middle class, Germany is the second largest importer of African ivory followed by India. At the fourth position is the Netherlands, importing ivory worth US$70 million in 2017. <br>
Other major importers include the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and China. Namibia is the only African country that imports large quantities of ivory at US$41 million in 2017. <br>
